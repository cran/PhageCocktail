\title{Design of the Best Phage Cocktail}
\usage{
## Default method:
PhageCocktail(pathway,FUN="ClusteringSearch",file.output=FALSE,
file.name="output.txt",limit=7)
}
\description{
It gives you the best phage cocktail which lyses the maximum
number of bacteria.

There are 4 possible methods within the function PhageCocktail(): "ExhaustiveSearch"; "ExhaustivePhi"; "ClusteringSearch"; and "ClusteringPhi".

\eqn{"ExhaustiveSearch"} gives you the best phage cocktail from a
phage bacteria infection network. It checks different phage cocktail sizes
from 1 to 7 and only stops before if it lyses all bacteria. Other option is
when users have decided not to obtain a phage cocktail size higher than a limit
value.

\eqn{"ExhaustivePhi"} firstly, the function PhageCoctail() finds Phi out. Phi is a formula
indicating the necessary phage cocktail size [Molina et al. (2021)<doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.564532>]. Phi needs
nestedness temperature and fill [Molina et al. (2021)<doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.564532>][Rodríguez Gironés et al. (2006)<doi:10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x>],
which are internally calculated. This method will only look for the best
combination (phage cocktail) with a Phi size.

\eqn{"ClusteringSearch"} firstly, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering
using Ward's algorithm is calculated for phages [Strauss et al. (2017)<doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0168288>]. They will be
clustered according to bacteria lysed by them. 'PhageCocktail' chooses how many
clusters are needed in order to select 1 phage per cluster [Kodinariya et al. (2013)].
Using the phages selected during the clustering, it checks different phage
cocktail sizes from 1 to 7 and only stops before if it lyses all bacteria. Other
option is when users have decided not to obtain a phage cocktail size higher than
a limit value.

\eqn{"ClusteringPhi"} firstly, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering using
Ward's algorithm is calculated for phages
[Strauss et al. (2017)<doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0168288>]. They will be clustered
according to bacteria lysed by them. 'PhageCocktail' chooses how many clusters
are needed in order to select 1 phage per cluster [Kodinariya et al. (2013)]. Once the
function (PhageCocktail()) has one phage per cluster, it calculates Phi
[Molina et al. (2021)<doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.564532>]. If the
number of clusters is less than Phi number, it will be changed to obtain, as
minimum, this quantity of candidates (phages). Then, it calculates the best
combination of Phi phages using those selected during the clustering with Ward
algorithm.

\arguments{
\item{pathway}{string with the input file pathway. The input file must be in
.xlsx format and must contain one PhageBacteria Infection Network (PBIN). This
PBIN must be in matrix format, that is, the input file must have only one sheet
with a matrix, whose rows are the bacteria and whose columns are the phages. It
is important to say that the first row must be devoted to the names/codes of the
phages. In the same way, the first column must be devoted to the names/codes of
the bacteria. Only the values 0 and 1 are considered to reflect the infection
relationship between involved phages and bacteria (0 = does not lyse and 1 =
lyses). In this way, the infection relationship can be represented by the names
of phages and bacteria, and by the position of the value (0 or 1) in the matrix.}
\item{FUN}{string indicating the function/method to execute: \eqn{"ExhaustiveSearch"}
;\eqn{"ExhaustivePhi"};\eqn{"ClusteringSearch"} (default option)
;\eqn{"ClusteringPhi"}.}
\item{file.output}{logical. If \eqn{FALSE} (default option), the program will
not create an output file. If \eqn{TRUE}, the program will write a file with the
results.}
\item{file.name}{string with the filename of the output file. Default option is
"output.txt"}
\item{limit}{Positive integer number indicating maximum phage cocktail size desired.
The range of options is: (1:7). Default option is 7. It is desirable to use limit
when the number of phages and/or bacteria is extremely high.}
}
\value{

\item{$file}{string indicating the input file used.}
\item{$method}{string indicating the function chosen.}
\item{$maxCocktailSize}{integer. Maximum phage cocktail size.}
\item{$allBacteriaLysed}{logical. If TRUE indicates that the set of phages
lyses all bacteria. If FALSE, not all bacteria are lysed by the phage cocktail.}
\item{$Result}{dataframe composed of the information of each phage cocktail size
(phage cocktail and number of bacteria lysed) and the list of lysed bacteria.

An example ("ClusteringPhi"):

"Result": {

 "Size3": [ "SajbenNagyP16", "SajbenNagyP3", "SajbenNagyP10", "18" ]
},

"BacteriaLysed": {

 "Size3": [ "SajbenNagyB1", "SajbenNagyB2", "SajbenNagyB3", "SajbenNagyB4",
 "SajbenNagyB5", "SajbenNagyB6", "SajbenNagyB10", "SajbenNagyB11", "Sajben
 NagyB13", "SajbenNagyB15", "SajbenNagyB16", "SajbenNagyB18", "Sajben
 NagyB19", "SajbenNagyB23", "SajbenNagyB24", "SajbenNagyB30", "Sajben
 NagyB31", "SajbenNagyB32" ]
}

As it is an output of executing "ClusteringPhi", there is only one phage cocktail.
The meaning is that the best Phage Cocktail of three phages is composed by
"Sajben-NagyP16", "Sajben-NagyP3" and "Sajben-NagyP10" lysing 18 bacteria shown
in the list called "BacteriaLysed".
}
\item{$non_usefulPhages}{vector of phages removed because they do not lyse any
bacterium. If all of them lyse some bacterium, this message will appear: "All
the phages are useful (all of them lyse some bacterium)"}
\item{$non_lysedBacteria}{vector of bacteria not lysed by any phage. If there
is no one, this message will appear: "All the bacteria are lysed by some phage"}

  #If the number of phages and/or bacteria is extremely high, it is
  #recommended to use limit option starting by 1 for "ExhaustiveSearch"
  #avoiding that the result takes too much time. If process took a short
  #period of time and it was desirable to test with a higher number of
  #phages, it could be done.
